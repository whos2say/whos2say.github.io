        <section class="program-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Sports Path helps participants build confidence, relationships, and leadership through sports.
            Some participants engage by playing; others thrive in support roles that keep them close to the team.
            We meet people where they are — and help them grow over time.
          </p>

          <h3>Core components</h3>

          <h2>A Lifelong Sports Participation Continuum</h2>
          <p>
            Every participant’s sports journey is different — and it can evolve. This pathway supports a
            progression from entry-level engagement to meaningful team contribution and leadership.
          </p>

          <h3>Phase 1: Engage</h3>

            <li>Try sports in supportive settings</li>
            <li>Build comfort with routines, rules, and environments</li>
            <li>Strengthen social connection through team culture</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 2: Contribute</h3>

            <li>Step into structured, reliable roles on a team</li>
            <li>Build responsibility through checklists and repeatable tasks</li>
            <li>Support game-day operations and team readiness</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 3: Lead</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mentor younger participants</li>
            <li>Represent community pride and inclusive team identity</li>
            <li>Grow visibility through sports storytelling and leadership</li>

        <!-- SCHOOL TEAM SUPPORT ROLES (NEW) -->
        <section class="program-section" id="for-schools">
          <h2>School Team Support Roles</h2>
          <p>
            Many participants form deep, positive relationships with school athletic communities.
            When they age out, those connections can be interrupted due to administrative and liability concerns.
            We help schools keep what’s working by providing a structured, supervised framework for inclusion.
          </p>

          <h3>Example roles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Manager Assistant</strong> (equipment, checklists, setup, breakdown)</li>
            <li><strong>Game-Day Operations</strong> (water, supplies, sideline readiness)</li>
            <li><strong>Stats / Film / Media Assistant</strong> (filming, simple stat tracking, highlights)</li>
            <li><strong>Team Culture Ambassador</strong> (morale, pre-game routines, introductions)</li>
            <li><strong>Community Storytelling Crew</strong> (interviews, recaps, social posts)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Safety & clarity (boundaries)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>No coaching or instruction</li>
            <li>No independent supervision of minors</li>
            <li>No transporting students</li>
            <li>On-site supervision by a designated staff member</li>
            <li>Roles and schedules defined and approved in advance</li>
          </ul>
